REACT NOTES

Organization Rules:
> Make sure to create an 'assets' folder (for images), a 'container' folder (for things
like app.js and app.css), and a 'components' folder!
> Components and Component folders should be named with a capital letter.

Other React Rules:
> Try to use only a FEW stateful components. The majority of your components
should be stateless components!

REACT JARGON

Stateful/Smart/Container Components
> A component that manages states. Before React v16, stateful referred only to
class based components. However, since now React Hooks can be used in both class
and function components, a stateful component is just any component that manages
the state.

Stateless/Dumb/Presentational Components
> A component that DOES NOT manage states.

Class-based Components
> ex. `class App extends Component { ... }`


Functional Components
> ex. `const app = (props) => { ... }`
